# Overview

This book will help you get started with the Burn deep learning framework.

Although it is still in progress, it is planned to be divided into multiple sections, catering to complete beginners and advanced users. For the time being, we offer an introductory guide in which we perform training and inference on a simple model, while highlighting certain peculiarities of Burn that set it apart from other frameworks.

Throughout the book, we assume a basic understanding of Rust and deep learning concepts.
