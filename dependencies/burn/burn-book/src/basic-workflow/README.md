# Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a custom model built with Burn.
We will train a simple convolutional neural network model on the MNIST dataset and prepare it for inference.

For clarity, we sometimes omit imports in our code snippets. For more details, please refer to the corresponding code in the `examples/guide` directory.
